## Overview

This repository demonstrates various hashing techniques tailored for clarity, efficiency, and learning. Explore different approaches side by side and deepen your understanding of how hashing strategies work in practice.

---

## Implemented Methods

The following methods are included, each in its separate module/file:

- Separate Chaining  
- Open Addressing  
- Quadratic Probing  
- Double Hashing  
- Rehashing  
- Perfect Hashing  

---

## Purpose

This project aims to serve as both a practical reference and an educational resource for anyone looking to understand, compare, and implement common hashing strategies in C++.

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dvlpernarvin/Hashing_Problem_Solving.git
    cd Hashing_Problem_Solving
    ```

2. Compile the solution you’d like to test:
    ```bash
    # Example: compile Separate Chaining
    g++ SeparateChaining.cpp -o separate_chaining
    ./separate_chaining
    ```

3. Review the code and experiment with inputs to see how each method handles collisions and performance trade-offs.
